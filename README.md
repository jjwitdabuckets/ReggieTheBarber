**Note:** The current implementation uses local image paths (e.g., `D:\Tshepo's Website\Tshepo.jpg`). These will need to be updated to relative paths (e.g., `assets/images/tshepo-profile.jpg`) before deployment.

## 🚀 Getting Started (For Development)

### Prerequisites

A modern web browser and a code editor (like VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.).

### Local Installation & Viewing

1.  **Download the project files** to your computer.
2.  **Navigate** to the project folder.
3.  **Open** the `index.html` file in your web browser.
    *   You can typically do this by right-clicking the file and selecting "Open with" your browser of choice (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).

### How to Customize Content

1.  **Text & Copy:** Edit text content directly within the `index.html` file.
2.  **Images:**
    *   Create an `assets/images/` folder in your project directory.
    *   Add your images (e.g., `tshepo-profile.jpg`, `merch-hoodie.png`).
    *   Update the `src` attributes in the HTML to point to the new paths (e.g., `src="assets/images/tshepo-profile.jpg"`).
3.  **Contact Details:** Update the phone number, email, and address in the **Booking** and **Footer** sections.
4.  **Services & Pricing:** Modify the services and prices in the **Services** and **Merch** sections.
5.  **Social Media Links:** Update the social media URLs in the footer.
6.  **Google Map Embed:** Replace the existing `src` URL in the iframe with a new embed code from Google Maps for the precise location.

## 📋 Deployment Checklist

To go live, the following steps need to be completed:

1.  [ ] **Purchase a Domain Name** (e.g., `tshepothebarber.com` or `macdeezy.co.za`).
2.  [ ] **Sign up for Web Hosting** ( providers like [Afrihost](https://www.afrihost.com/), [Xneelo](https://www.xneelo.co.za/), or international ones like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for simple hosting).
3.  [ ] **Fix Image Paths:** Change all local image paths (`D:\Tshepo's Website\...`) to relative paths within the project.
4.  [ ] **Upload Files:** Transfer the `index.html` file and the `assets/` folder to the web server via FTP or the hosting provider's file manager.
5.  [ ] **Configure Form Handling:** Replace the JavaScript alert in the booking form with a real backend solution (e.g., a PHP script, Formspree, or a Netlify Form).
6.  [ ] **Test Thoroughly:** Test all links, the form, and layout on various devices and browsers.
